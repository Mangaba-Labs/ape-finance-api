# IN DEVELOPMENT 🔨🔨🔨


### Tech stack at the moment

- **Fiber**
- **Gorm**
- **Postgres**
- **Docker**

#### Ideas that we are grooming to implement

- **Kubernetes**
- **Some kind of struct validator (like ozzo)**
- **Build some security middlewares for API most common attacks**


## Infos about the app itself

We are planning to use React Native to build the mobile front-end, and in order to build the web app we are seeking to use React + Next.JS


### Product ideas
By now we are planning to use openWeather API for bring forecast data, but in a further moment will be awesome if we bring other data providers to our forecast system
